The aim of our Project “Talk with Doc” is to ease the process of getting medical treatment and health checkup 
in a way that saves both time and effort. It fulfills the purpose of consulting patients irrespective of the time and place. 
We used J2EE(SpringBoot 2.6.5) for our backend (REST API services) of “Talk with Doc” and in this we used mysql database to store 
our all record. We also used SpringToolSuit most compatible version to setup the project, based on Spring core framework we provided 
all secure dependencies and for the UI we used ReactJS and bootstrap(5.1.1) to customize 
the look of our app and axios(0.21.4) to communicate frontend to backend.

The aim of our Project “Talk Your Doc” is to provide online Doctor consultancy service. 
It fulfills the purpose of consulting patients irrespective of the time and place. 
To build our project, we used latest technologies such as SpringToolSuit to setup the project.
SpringBoot(2.6.5) for our backend (REST API services) and for storing all the records, we used MySQL database.
Based on Spring core framework we provided all secure dependencies.
For the UI, we used ReactJS and bootstrap(5.1.1) to customize the look of our app.
Axios(0.21.4) to communicate frontend to backend.
